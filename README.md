# Data-Mining-on-Online-shopping-Apps-using-SPSS

This project is all about the online shopping applications, employing data mining techniques to uncover valuable insights into consumer behaviour. The study utilized a questionnaire distributed through Google Forms, a dataset of 320 responses from individuals aged 18-45 and above. After meticulous data cleaning and analysis, statistical tests, particularly the Kruskal-Wallis test, were applied to draw meaningful conclusions. 
The primary findings highlight Flipkart as the most widely used online shopping app, among the respondents with a specific focus on the 18-25 age group of female users dominating clothing purchases.
